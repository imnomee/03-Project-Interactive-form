# Techdegree 3 - Project-Interactive-form

In this project, we used Javascript to enhace an interactive registration form.
Using supplied HTML and CSS files. We added our own Javascript to make the form more user-friendly.
We added customized, conditional behaviours by validation user input and providing helpful error messages.
So when the user enters the invalid information or leaves the field empty, the validtion will revoke the submission process.

We used some of the regex (Regular Expressions) to test and match for validations.
